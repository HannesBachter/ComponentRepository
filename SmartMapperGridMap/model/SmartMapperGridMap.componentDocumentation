ComponentDocumentation SmartMapperGridMap{
	Description : "The SmartMapperGridMap provides mapping services based on occupancy grid maps. Laser scans are taken for building a current and a longterm map.

					The current map represents the latest environment of the robot. It can be preoccupied with grids of the longterm map and can be used for path planning e.g. with SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch. It contains either occupied cells or free cells (binary). An optional obstacle growing can be applied to the current map.

					The longterm map holds cell values from 0 to 255. Values from 0 to 127 denote the traversability where 0 is completely free. Values from 128 to 255 are special values: Obstacles are marked with 128, cells occupied by obstacle growing with 129 and undeletable grids are marked with 130. The cell values can be accumulated over time to represent the environment over a longer period.

					Both grid maps can be saved to XPM and XML and loaded from XML files.

					Note: This component is used in Tutorials (e.g. Lesson 1). "
