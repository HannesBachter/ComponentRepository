ComponentDocumentation SmartAmcl{
	Description : 	"SmartAmcl implements the Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization (Amcl) algorithm.
					Localization is based on a particle filter and a pre-captured grid map of the environment. Amcl maintains a set of possible robot poses and updates this distribution by comparing laser scans against the pre-captured map. Amcl is adaptive because the amount of particles depends on the pose certainty: large number of particles if uncertainty increases and vice versa.
					
					Based on its localization, SmartAmcl sends position updates to the base server (e.g. SmartPioneerBaseServer).
