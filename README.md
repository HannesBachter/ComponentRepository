# ComponentRepository

This repository contains robotics software-component projects. See README.md in the individual component subfolders for the detailed explanation of the individual component's services and configurations options.

All components depend on the [ACE/SmartSoft Framework](https://github.com/Servicerobotics-Ulm/AceSmartSoftFramework) and have component-specific (i.e. individual) dependendies to further libraries according to the componen's internal implementation.

All the components have been modelled and developed with the [SmartMDSD Toolchain v3](http://robmosys.eu/wiki/baseline:environment_tools:smartsoft:smartmdsd-toolchain:start).

License: Each component has its individual license depending on the internally used algorithms and libraries.
