ComponentDocumentation ComponentTTS 
{
	Description : 
			"SmartTTS is a component for text to speech (tts) synthesis. SmartTTS pipes speech output messages to stdin of an arbitrary executable. 
			It is thus a simple wrapper for all tts applications that accept text via stdin, e.g. mbrola, festival or /bin/cat for debugging. 
			It provides send and query services. Speech messages will be appended to a message queue. The queue is processed first in first out. 
			Messages of which the discard time is in the past (at the time of processing) are discarded.
			On Ubuntu 16.04, the speech-dispatcher package can be used. Configure
			the component to use spd-say: set parameter 'player' to '/usr/bin/spd-say -e'."
