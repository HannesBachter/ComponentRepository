ComponentDocumentation SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch{
	Description : "The SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch provides path planning services based on grid maps. It uses a grid map from a map building component (e.g. SmartMapperGridMap) and sends an intermediate waypoint as well as the goalpoint to the motion execution (e.g. SmartCdlServer).

					A wave propagation algorithm starting from goal cells backward to the current position of the robot is used to calculate a path. The path planning is further enhanced by a path shortening heuristic: the path is followed starting at the current robot position until a straight line from the robot position to the cell in question on the path interferes with an obstacle. The prior cell is then sent as an intermediate waypoint. The geometric path planning is applied continuously every one second.

					Several goal circles and/or goal lines can be specified as goals in the planner. The planner will generate a path to the goal with the shortest distance.

					The SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch for example can be used with SmartCdlServer which cannot handle local minimas. Goals are then specified in the SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch. A CDL_GOAL_REACHED event is fired by the CDL component as soon as the final goal is reached.

					Note: This component is used in Tutorials (e.g. Lesson 1).

	NeutralMainState : "The path planning execution cycle is stopped. No path planning is performed, no intermediate waypoints and goal points are sent."
	ComponentMainState PathPlanning : "The component will continuously (every 1 second) plan a path to the goalpoints. Intermediate waypoints and goals are sent."
	
	ComponentService CurMapClient {
		Description : "The planner will plan paths in grid maps sent to this port. Typically connected to a map building component such as SmartMapperGridMap."
		NeutralMainState : "Port is neutral, does not consume new input while in this state."
		ComponentMainState PathPlanning : "Latest map from this port is considered for path planning."
	}
	ComponentService BaseStateClient {
		Description : "Base states as input for path planning shall be sent to this port. The path is planned based on the current position sent through this port. Typically connected to the robot base, e.g. SmartPioneerBaseServer."
		NeutralMainState : "Port is neutral, does not consume new input while in this state."
		ComponentMainState PathPlanning : "The latest position is considered as the current position for path planning."

		DynamicWiringPort : "Slave part of wiring pattern. It is responsible for changing the port connections within the component."
		StatePort : "See States for descriptions of possible states and their meaning."
		ParameterPort : "Accepts various parameters for managing goals. See Parameters."

	ComponentService PlannerGoalServer {
		Description : "If a path was found (event PLANNER_NO_ERROR fired), this port pushes an valid (invalid flag set to false) intermediate waypoint and goal point calculated by the planner to the motion execution. If no path was found, the waypoint and goalpoint are sent with the invalid flag set to true."
		NeutralMainState : "Port is neutral, does not send any intermediate waypoints and goal points while in this state."
		ComponentMainState PathPlanning : "Planner goals are sent to the motion execution as intermediate waypoints and goal points."

	ComponentService PlannerEventServer {
		Description : " The event state PLANNER_UNKNOWN can be used for activation if the current state is unknown. Events are sent on every change.

						The port will send the events listed below:

						- PLANNER_NO_PATH: Fired if no path could be found for at least five seconds. Invalid goals (invalid flag=true) are pushed via plannerUpdateNewestServer when no path was found.
						- PLANNER_NO_ERROR: No errors in planner, valid goals (invalid flag=false) are pushed via plannerUpdateNewestServer.
						- PLANNER_UNKNOWN_ERROR: An unknown error occurred.
						- PLANNER_NO_GOAL_AVAILABLE: No goals available.
						- PLANNER_GOAL_NOT_MARKED: Every goal cell is already occupied. The goal cells could not be marked.
						- PLANNER_START_OCCUPIED_OBSTACLE: The start cell (current robot position) is occupied by an obstacle.
						- PLANNER_START_OCCUPIED_GOAL: The robot is standing on the goal cell.
						- PLANNER_WRONG_MAPID: The latest grid map is of another id than the current planner id. The planner will not plan anything and will not send intermediate waypoints and goal points.
